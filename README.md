# Finnish-Slang-Translator
This is a library of code that takes a given corpus in Finnish, identifies all the slang words it has, and gets their translations from the Finnish Urban Dictionary

To use it, download all the files (like the lists and dictionaries, and lemmatizers) becasue they contain the functions and variables that the script needs to operate. Then, run the main script, and in the line in the beginning where it starst "corpus = open( ... )  insert the name of the file you want to examine. 

I want to send a huge thank you to the Kotimaisten Kielten Keskus Nykysuomen Sanalista  ( approx. "The Homeland Language Center's List of words in modern-day Finnish" ) I used their data to make the "sanalista" variable. I very much appreciate the work they did and how it facilitated my project!

Here's their website. http://kaino.kotus.fi/sanat/nykysuomi/
